Technical Interview Prep Project

Overview

This project is designed to help with technical interview preparation by implementing and practicing key algorithms and data structures. It provides hands-on coding exercises and performance analysis to improve problem-solving skills.

Features

Implementation of common sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort).

Data structure implementations including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Solutions to popular coding problems from LeetCode, CodeSignal, and HackerRank.

Dynamic programming and recursion problem-solving exercises.

System design concepts and example implementations.

Performance analysis and optimization techniques.

Technologies Used

Java (Sorting and data structures implementation)

C++ (Algorithmic problem-solving and performance testing)

Python (Data science-based coding challenges and scripting)

Setup and Usage

Running Code:

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>

Compile and run Java solutions:

javac AlgorithmSolutions.java
java AlgorithmSolutions

Compile and run C++ implementations:
